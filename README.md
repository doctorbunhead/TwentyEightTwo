Very simple app that follows the 20, 8, 2 rule for office workers.
This will prompt you to change state between sitting, standing and moving. I added 10 seconds to each to allow for change of state as this is how long most moving desks take to move. 

When triggered it uses topmost and center to client so it will pop right in the middle of the active window.
